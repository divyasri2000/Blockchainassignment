 A Blockchain is a type of diary or spreadsheet containing information about transactions. Each 
 transaction generates a hash.Each block refers to the previous block and together make the 
 Blockchain and it is a mix of Technology distributed database and cryptography where data is 
 unchangeable
 Tamper-proof
 Immutable--immortal,it can't be changed
 verified


2.What is the core problem blockchain trying to solve? 
-----problem with internet-----
*Authenticity--fake news
*security
*need of powerful third party for thrust?
for solving three problems blockchain came into picture


3.What are the few features which blockchain will give you?
*avoid hacking--connot be corrupted--"Immutability"
*decentralized
*security
*data transparency
*verifiable
*tamper-proof
*unchangable
*no third-party
*user control
*Authentic nature
*consensus

4.what all things does a blockchain contains?
1. Block number
2. Transaction records
3. Previous block Signature
4. Mining key

5.How is verifiability of block chain attained?
The Blockchain is verifiable because of the distributed ledgers and cryptography.
the data is distributed to various users it generate a unique fingerprint key for each data.
By checking this key among various users data can be verified.
